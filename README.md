# Java Integer Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Java related to integer overflow.  When you add 1 to the maximum value of an integer, it wraps around to the minimum integer value instead of throwing an exception. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and difficult-to-debug errors in your program.  The solution demonstrates how to handle such situations.
